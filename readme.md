## New Here

We want to guide people seeking help in a new city by listing, categorizing and filtering available help-options in that city.  

The project emphasises translations and iconography when presenting data. Geographic locations of available help are marked on a city map. A custom CMS with user management is used for populating and organizing of available help-options.
